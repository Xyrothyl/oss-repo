## 2. Reading


### 3. 2 things:
Ask probing questions to get an understanding of what aspect(s) they don't understand. Help them towards the answer but try not to give it away.
### 4. Reflection:
The story in this chapter stresses the significance of open source and the right to modify a program for your own uses. Jesse simply added some features to the school's internal search engine that improved its usability so more people were able to use the campus resource. As a reseult of the increased user base, some music files were shared and distributed using the network. The RIAA, in its pursuit of damages, went after Jesse in addition to some others for simply making this change on the school's internally public system. Jesse didn't own or operate the system he added on to, but he was still charged with the damages as if he were the pirate. One is reminded of the Futurama episode Overclockwise, in season 6, where the owners of the robot Bender are sued for making improvements to him, their own property. People should be able to modify code they have access to for their own uses without worry of repurcussions of others misusing the new software.


## 3. Linux

## 6. Reflection
I want to work on my FRC team's project Wyrd, a custom robot code framework extension of WPILib. I am already an active mentor of the team and work with the mentor overseeing the project. The idea, aside from having a customizable robot code framework, is to give students the opportunity to work on a large and complicated project for practical experience. As such, there is a lot of organizational and maintainance work to be done in addition to developing core functionality as future foundation. Since it's summer, now is a good time to build on and improve with what we learned from this past season. There are already a number of total contributors on the project and my role is already defined by others, so I can fit in and help development progress smoothly.
