# Lab 4: Licensing

### 1. Creative Commons License

### 2. Four Criteria of Free Software

### 3. Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?
Having a license is important if you want to protect your copyright of your project/code. Different licenses do this and other protections/restrictions depending on the language.\
Having a license not only protects your IP, but indicates how the code can be modified and redistributed so you can have an open source project with some more control.\
A license also provides you with protections from responsibility of any effects from other people running your code.

### 4. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
A project without a license is making 0 promises with what you're allowed to do with it. It could later become more restrictive when a license is added \
and so your use and redistribution could be disallowed, interfering with everything that propogated the code. Essentially, there isn't enough information to let you actually use it prudently.

### 5. Failure to Follow the Open System Model
I generally agree with the author's points of why the Web outpaced and overshadowed gopher. For something like this, seemingly silly factors like the name \
of each having an impact. When it comes to something technical like this merging towards the mainstream, a small advantage in momentum can be indicative of a \
big lead later on. I think the main reason for the Web winning out is the bodies behind each project and their influence. The World Wide Web was developed by \
CERN leading into the LHC's first experiments for sharing the massive amounts of data with scientists around the world. Gopher was made as a university file service. \
The international scientific community using the Web, even only for the inital purpose of data sharing, gives the Web a huge advantage over gopher from the get-go.
The nail in the coffin, I think, is indeed how people in charge of developing gopher left for the Web instead so it could no longer realistically keep up \
development in features and fixes.

### 6. Commercial Licesing
Microsoft uses the MIT license so they can keep commercialization and not be held responsible. Unlike linux with GPL, MIT also allows microsoft to sublicense their code \
as indicated by tldrlegal. It also says that Google can sublicense Android and prohibit use of the logo with the apache license.
